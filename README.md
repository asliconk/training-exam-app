### Getting Started
```

It is a desktop application created for students preparing for exams.There are 3 different user interfaces.

These are the admin, the examiner and the student.The admin and the examiner have the authority to add, update and delete questions.

The most important feature of the application is that it is created with the 6 sigma algorithm.

Each question is presented to the student according to the sigma times determined by the student or the examiner.

If a question is known 6 times, it will not appear in front of the student again. 

There is also a report section in the application where the student can follow his/her progress.

Visual studio 2022 was used with C# programming language.
